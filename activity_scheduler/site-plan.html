    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this site is to coordinate schedules with friends and acquaintances,
      to allow any member of a group to propose an activity that every member can attend,
      and to carry notifications of said proposals to other members of the group.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
      <!--The audicence should be as broad as possible. -->
      The audience consists of everyone 12 and older.
      The idea is to reach out to groups of casually connected individuals, rather than formal clubs where people are free to join or leave.
      Most people may interact with this on a mobile device.
      Some of the group meetings may be between different kinds of people.

    <h3>Website Logo</h3>
    <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/8cff72-b07200-001701-130a00-e4c3d5"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/8cff72-b07200-001701-130a00-e4c3d5</a>

    <table class="colors">
      <tr>
        <th>Primary</th>
        <th>Secondary</th>
        <th>Accent 1</th>
        <th>Accent 2</th>
      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
        <td class="primary">#8cff72</td>
        <td class="secondary">#b07200</td>
        <td class="accent1">#001701</td>
        <td class="accent2">#130a00</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 10-12------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

    <h4>
      Heading Font: Merriweather
      <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Paragraph Font: Roboto
      <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
      Hello, this is a normal paragraph.
       It should be okay to read this. It will be boring, though.
        This is just a test to see how the fonts work.
    </p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      Hello, this is a colored paragraph.
       It should be okay to read this.
       It should be slightly more interesting than the other paragraph.
        This is just a test to see how the fonts and colors work.
    </p>

    <!-- ------------------------Step 13------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
    <nav>
      <a href="#">Home</a>
      <a href="#">Page2</a>
      <a href="#">Contact Us</a>
    </nav>

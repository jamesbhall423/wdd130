    <h2>James Hall</h2>
    <p>I am a computer science major. I enjoy programming, and I have created a few of my own games. 
        I feel like a web/online project is different from most other projects because it is better
         for interaction between different people. So my usual practice of writing programs for myself
          is coming to an end.</p>
    <p>I also enjoy being on the piano. I've been playing for over 10 years, 
        and I play my own music in addition to playing hymns for church.</p>
